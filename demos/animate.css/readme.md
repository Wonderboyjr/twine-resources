# Animate.css Readme

See the [live demos](//mikewesthad.com/twine-resources/demos/animate.css/examples.html) in examples.html to see the library in action. You can import examples.html into Twine and open it up. The demos are heavily commented.

## Animate.css

This demo integrates [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) into Twine. Animate.css works by providing a set of pre-built CSS animations that can be applied to elements simply by using a set of class names. See the passages and story stylesheets in examples.html for instructions and see animate.css's [readme](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css/blob/master/README.md) for additional documentation.

The demo also shows how to customize exisiting animations and how to import animations from [cssanimate](http://cssanimate.com/), a CSS animation generator.
